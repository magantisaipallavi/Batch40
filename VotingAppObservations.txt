Result APP: http://13.251.89.204:31001/


Case 1: Deleting Voter Pod 
	1. command : kubectl delete pod/vote-94849dc97-hg7r2
	2. observation : Pod recreated and data is intact ,downtime was just while pod creation.
	
Case 2: Deleting worker pod 
	1. command : kubectl delete pod/worker-dd46d7584-8s4rz
	2. observation : Pod deletion took time ,after dele pod got recreated but did't see any issue in data and able to vote and see the result.
	
Case 3: Deleting db pod 
	1. command : kubectl delete pod/db-b54cd94f4-58n8m
	2. observation : Pod deletion took time ,after dele pod got recreated ,voting app is working fine entries are being modfied in db correctly.
					 But result app is not working.
	   commands to check voter app is working:
	   kubectl pod/vote-94849dc97-hw7bf
	   kubectl pod/db-b54cd94f4-4jcxm
	   Login to db pod : kubectl exec -it pod/db-b54cd94f4-4jcxm -- /bin/sh
						 psql -U postgres
						 select * from votes; // votes are adding to db properly after db pod restart only issue with result app
					 
					 
    Problem : As result app makes the client connection with before pod and same client is being used after restart
	Solution : 
				1. Restart/deleting Result pod (kubectl delete pod/result-5d57b59f4b-gvxsb) [verfied: Result and voting app is working]
				2. Modifying the server.js logic to reconnect if connection losts/ any issue
				3. Making server.js connecting postgres pod with nodePort
