Replica Set: Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set :

  When we need to run on all pods in a cluster we can go for daemon set (Total number of pods = Total number of nodes where scheduling is allowed)
  But where as replica set just ensures that number of desired pods are running

Deployment : Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.

  Rolling Update can be used to make sure zero downtime
  
Service : You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.
  
  Need to check the logs of application and see if port is blocked/used by any other application if so ,delete the resources and modify`the port and can try again
